    calling and adding callbacks.

    A callback can be one of two different forms.  "Notification callbacks" are
    callbacks that are called when something happens - for example, when a new
    part of a multipart message is encountered by the parser.  "Data callbacks"
    are called when we get some sort of data - for example, part of the body of
    a multipart chunk.  Notification callbacks are called with no parameters,
    whereas data callbacks are called with three, as follows::

        data_callback(data, start, end)

    The "data" parameter is a bytestring. "start" and "end" are integer indexes into the "data"
    string that represent the data of interest.  Thus, in a data callback, the slice
    `data[start:end]` represents the data that the callback is "interested in".  The callback is
    not passed a copy of the data, since copying severely hurts performance.
